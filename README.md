# Conclusion

By scrutinizing the data, for a movie to be in successful criteria.
Average Budget must be around 60 million dollar, The average duration of the movie must be 113 minutes, Any one of these should be in the cast: Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks, Sylvester Stallone, Cameron Diaz, Genre must be Action, Adventure, Thriller, Comedy, Drama.
This analysis was done considering the movies which had a significant amount of profit of around 50 million dollars. This might not completely error-free but by following this suggestion one can increase the probability of a movie becoming a hit. Moreover, we are not sure if the data provided to us is completely correct and up-to-date. As mentioned before the budget and revenue column do not have a currency unit, it might be possible different movies have a budget in the different currency according to the country they are produced in. So a disparity arises here which can state the complete analysis wrong. Dropping the rows with missing values also affected the overall analysis.
